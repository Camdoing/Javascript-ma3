JavaScript MA03
----------------
Level 2

1. In your own words, describe what JavaScript Code Style is.
This is a good way to quality check a code. There are many code style programs out there, but the main common feature is that, they let you know if there are any errors in the code.

2. What is a Regular Expression?
These are patterns used to match character combinations in strings. In JavaScript regular expressions are also objects.

3. What does the .random() method do?
This method is a method for producing random numbers. When it's executed, it returns a random number that can be anywhere between 0 and 1. The 0 is included and 1 is excluded.

4. What does the .sort() method do?
This method sorts an array alphabetically. The method accepts an optional argument which is a function that compares two elements of the array.

5. What does the .reverse() method do?
This method reverses an array in place. The first array element becomes the last and the last becomes the first.

6. List two examples of bad JavaScript code.
Here are two random examples:

Example 1:
//bad:
var someVar1 = 'a';
var someVar2 = 'b';
var someVar3 = 'c';
 
//good:
var someVar1 = 'a',
    someVar2 = 'b',
    someVar3 = 'c';

Example 2:
//bad:
var Color = 'red';
var SomeNumber = 234;
var AnArray = [1,2,3];
var Foo = { bar: 123 };

Variable names should only begin with a capital if they’re pointing to constructor functions.

7. What data types can a JSON object contain?
At least 6 data types; string, number, object, array, boolean and null. JSON values cannot be a function, a date or undefined.

8. What is minifying JavaScript Code?
This is a process of minimizing code and markup in web pages. It does reduce load times and bandwidth usage on websites and improves site speed and accessibility. The user experience gets better.

9. What is a global variable?
Global variables are variables that are defined outside of any function, method, closure, or type context.
